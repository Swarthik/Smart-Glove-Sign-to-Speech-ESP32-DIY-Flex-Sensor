##  Title

Smart Glove for Sign Language to Speech Conversion using DIY Flex Sensors and ESP32


##  Publication Details

This research work has been successfully published in a conference/journal as part of the academic mini project.

The paper presents the design and implementation of a low-cost assistive communication system that translates hand gestures into text and speech output using self-fabricated flex sensors.

The proposed system utilizes:

- DIY Flex Sensors fabricated using Graphite Sheet and Aluminium Foil
- ESP32 Microcontroller for gesture processing
- Bluetooth Communication for wireless transmission
- MIT App Inventor based Android Application for text and speech output


##  Novel Contribution

The major contribution of this research work is the development of a cost-effective self-fabricated flex sensor as an alternative to commercially available sensors, significantly reducing the overall system cost while maintaining acceptable accuracy in gesture detection.
